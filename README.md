# MailtoHandler

**Say goodbye to broken mailto links that frustrate your users.**

A lightweight JavaScript library that transforms the outdated mailto experience into a modern, user-friendly email client selection interface.

## The Problem We Solve

**Frustrated with email links not opening in your browser?**

We've all been there. You click on an email link expecting to compose a message in your favorite web-based email client, but instead:

- Your computer tries to open a desktop email app you never use
- You get a confusing "No email program is associated" error
- You end up manually copying the email address and opening Gmail/Outlook separately

This happens because `mailto:` links were designed decades ago when everyone used desktop email clients. Today, most people use web-based email services through their browsers.

## The Story Behind MailtoHandler

While building my portfolio website, I encountered the classic mailto problem that plagues developers everywhere. Clicking email links didn't open my preferred web email client - instead, I got system errors or unwanted desktop apps trying to launch.

After spending a few days researching solutions and finding only complex workarounds, I decided to build something better. MailtoHandler was born from the frustration of this common UX problem that affects millions of users daily.

Since most desktop and PC users today prefer web-based email clients over native applications, this library bridges that gap by giving users the freedom to choose their preferred email client when clicking any email link.

## The Solution

MailtoHandler intercepts mailto links and presents users with a clean, modern interface to choose their preferred email client - whether it's Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo, or any other web or desktop client.

### Before vs After

**Before:** Broken, frustrating experience

```html
<a href="mailto:contact@example.com">Email Us</a>
<!-- User clicks ‚Üí Error or unwanted app opens -->
```

**After:** Smooth, user-friendly experience

```html
<a href="mailto:hello@example.com?subject=Hello&body=Hi there!">Email us</a>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mailto-handler@1.0.0/dist/mailto-handler.min.js"></script>
<script>
  new MailtoHandler({ theme: "auto" });
</script>
```

Now users get a beautiful modal asking which email client they want to use!
